# WoW Renovate Data Source


![](./docs/wow_renovate_data.png)
![](docs/license_badge.svg)

> A data source for [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/) to track World of Warcraft interface versions. This allows automated dependency updates for WoW addon TOC files.

## Features

- Automatically fetches WoW version information from CurseForge API
- Supports all WoW variants:
  - Retail (1.0.0 - current)
  - Classic Era (1.13.x - 1.15.x)
  - The Burning Crusade Classic (2.5.x)
  - Wrath of the Lich King Classic (3.4.x)
  - Cataclysm Classic (4.4.x)
  - Mists of Pandaria Classic (5.5.x)
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated updates
- Compatible with Renovate's custom datasource feature

## Setup

### 1. Get a CurseForge API Key

1. Go to [CurseForge Console](https://console.curseforge.com/)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Generate an API key

### 2. Fork and Configure This Repository

1. Fork this repository
2. Add your CurseForge API key as a GitHub secret named `CURSEFORGE_API_KEY`
3. The GitHub Action will run every 6 hours to check for new versions

### 3. Configure Renovate in Your Addon Project

Add this configuration to your addon project's `renovate.json`:

```json
{
  "customDatasources": {
    "wow-interface": {
      "defaultRegistryUrlTemplate": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ragedunicorn/wow-renovate-data/master/versions.json",
      "transformTemplates": [
        "{\"releases\": $.versions.map(v => ({\"version\": v.version, \"releaseTimestamp\": $.lastUpdated}))}"
      ]
    }
  },
  "customManagers": [
    {
      "customType": "regex",
      "description": "Update WoW Interface versions in TOC files",
      "fileMatch": ["\\.toc$"],
      "matchStrings": [
        "## Interface:\\s*(?<currentValue>\\d+)"
      ],
      "datasourceTemplate": "custom.wow-interface",
      "depNameTemplate": "wow-interface",
      "versioningTemplate": "regex:^(?<major>\\d)(?<minor>\\d{2})(?<patch>\\d{2})$"
    }
  ]
}
```

## How It Works

1. The CurseForge API client fetches all WoW game versions
2. The version parser filters and extracts WoW versions
3. Interface version numbers are calculated from version strings (e.g., "1.15.3" â†’ "11503")
4. Results are saved to `versions.json` for Renovate to consume
5. GitHub Actions runs periodically to keep the data up-to-date

## Manual Usage

To manually fetch and update versions:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env file with your API key
echo "CURSEFORGE_API_KEY=your-key-here" > .env

# Fetch latest versions
npm run fetch
```

## Version Format

WoW interface versions follow this pattern:
- Major version (1 digit) + Minor version (2 digits) + Patch version (2 digits)
- Example: Version 1.15.3 becomes Interface 11503
